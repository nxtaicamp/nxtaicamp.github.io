        <h1>We are different</h1>
        <p>
            We strongly believe that the future of our world lies in AI and the first steps to the future start today. Our students
            learn the basics of AI, from the initial theory, all the way to mastery, where they will have the skills to implement
            their own projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            NXT AI students start their first two weeks delving deep into AI, learning Python, advanced data science, algorithms, and
            the fundementals of AI. Spread across the two weeks, students will complete small projects with what they learn to ensure
            deep understanding and have access to around-the-clock mentors who can guide them through problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following that, they will get to spend the next week creating their own AI projects, with guidance from our mentors, to 
            ensure success and build transferable skills to other domains of interest and present them at our camp-wide expo, where
            projects compete for a prize.

        <h1>Our team and beliefs</h1>
        <p>
            Our mentors go through a rigorous process to pick out those who are best equipped to teach students and offer guidance
            to any questions they have. We strongly believe that the most important part of learning is a good mentor, someone to
            guide students when they hit roadblocks, and we never had those -- therefore, NXT AI hopes to offer these to students,
            completely free of charge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of our mentors have real-world experience in AI, ranging from research at organizations, internships at FAANG companies,
            and foundings of successful startups, ensuring that they know end-to-end what skills students need to flourish.

        <h1>Access to Resources</h1>
        <p>
            Access to AI is most often hindered by a lack of resources, because it is, by nature, a resource intensive field. However,
            NXT AI aims to give students the most possible to be able to build the future, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>$5,000 for AWS credits to spin up clusters of powerful GPUs for training and inference</li>
            <li>Microsoft Azure credits to access state-of-the-art pre-built models and pipelines</li>
            <li>Resources and funding for projects from industry donations and partners including Apple</li>
        </ul>
