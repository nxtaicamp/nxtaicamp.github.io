            STEM is more than an acronym to us; rather than just represting fields of study, it is integrated in our lives.
            Through our nonprofit organization, we hope to teach children across the world what powers our daily lives.
            It is our mission to give our generation the tools necessary to understand the our <span class = "hook_special">
            changing world</span>.

        <h3 class = "hook_para">
            Currently, we are launching with courses in Beginner Python, Advanced Python, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,
            and Applications in Artificial Intelligence. We are also onboarding tutors -- email us at

            We strongly believe that the future of our world lies in STEM, and our first courses represent the changes happening 
            <span class = "hook_special">now</span>. We currently have 4 courses:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Beginner Python: Introduces students to STEM with Python, a <span class = "hook_special">foundational</span>
                    language that is easy to learn and even easier to start building the future with
                </li>
                <li>
                    Advanced Python: Meant for students with a grasp on Python to start learning more advanced features of the
                    language and building <span class = "hook_special">web, desktop, and mobile</span> apps
                </li>
                <li>
                    Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Introduces students to AI with a simple pathway. Discusses popular
                    AI frameworks and goes deeper than other courses and talks about <span class = "hook_special">the why and
                    not just the how</span> of how models work
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications in Artificial Intelligence: For students who know some AI, introduces them into where AI can be 
                    applied and helps them build their <span class = "hook_special">own AI applications</span>
                </li>

        <h1>Who are you guys?</h1>
        <p>
            Our mentors are well-versed in Python and AI, and have extensive knowledge in both areas. 
            Our founder, <a href = "https://aarushgupta.com">Aarush Gupta</a> has a history of developing impactful AI
            services, including <a href = "https://memorai.aarushgupta.com">MemorAI</a>, which had ~170 users from 
            Irvington High School and ~140 users from across the world and is doing AI research and related work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mentors go through a rigorous process to pick out those who know a lot about the fields, but are
            also good at teaching, a skill that makes them perfect for our students. The most important feature about them
            is that they are <span class = "hook_special">self taught</span>, which means they know the best way to
            learn and can teach students best as well.
